        Hello design team folks at
        <b> Doist,</b>
      </p>
      <br>
      <p class="">
        Raised in a small town in the Dominican Republic. From an early age, I loved the idea of
        building things
        and helping to create products and services.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Nowadays, I am a product designer building and scaling stuff for my clients. I love what I do, and the
        contributions
        I have made to my clients earned me a respectable designer's profile. However, indeed "great just isn't good
        enough."; there is something fundamental missing when you work independently; the feeling of growth alongside
        others.</p>

      <p class="experience__header">WHY
        <!-- company -->
        DOIST?</p>
    </columns>
  </row>
  <row>
    <columns large="12" small="12" class="">
      <p>
        I believe that as a
        <!-- company -->
        <b>Doist</b>
        Product Designer I would have the opportunity to create real value for
        millions of
        people building the future. Besides, working in a company as forward-thinking and diverse as
        <b>
          Doist
        </b>
        would
        allow
        me to continue doing what I most like, namely facing new challenges on a regular basis and working out
        innovative
        solutions.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>Finally, I am just a big fan of
        <!-- company -->
        <b>Doist
        </b>
        and it’s different products. I like its history (it's being born with humble beginnings), and I share it’s core
        principle.</p>
